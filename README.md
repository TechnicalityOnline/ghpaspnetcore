# ghpaspnetcore

GHP stands for GitHub Practice (not affiliated with or endorsed by GitHub).

The project is purely to let developers who are new to GitHub to practice forking and making pull requests. The application doesn't do anything productive so there's no risk of breaking it.

Think of this application as a wall you are invited to spray graffiti on. Feel free to add whatever you like. Just keep it clean and non-controversial. (I reserve the right to decide what's controversial.)

Once the pull request is accepted and merged into the master branch, it will be visible at https://ghpaspnetcore.technicality.online.

Depending on the response to this, I'll publish projects for other languages.
